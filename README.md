# Hana
An invite checking bot for apms!

Hana is an invite checking bot for apms to be utilized to check for invalid invites during or for a mass. It can help you to see whether the invite's valid so you don't have to post invalid links! It is coded to perform like the previous Sakura (Sakura#3774) that Flare#2851 has coded.
